# Fluttern

Fluttern is a web app made with Flutter to list Flutter internships/jobs for the community. It uses Google Sheet as a backend, simplifying the whole listing process.

## Problem
We identified two problems:

 - The internship or job opportunities got lost in the Discord channel
 - It was difficult to tell who was looking for oppotunities.

## Solution
The listing on the web app makes navigating and viewing the opprtunities simple.

With the members tab, the community users can fill out a form, specify if there are open to job/internships opprtunities and it would be shown on their cards accordingly.
